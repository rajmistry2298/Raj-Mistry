# Academic Projects:
## Bechlor's Projects:
### 1. Assignment Partner
* It is a web-based application which provides platform to students where they can post their assignment questions which are difficult for them to solve. Other students can see these posted questions and can help each other.
* During my bachlor's this was the first ever project I worked on. In this prject I worked in team of 2 people. We implemented this **rsponsive web-based application** using **HTML and CSS**.

### 2. Sliding Puzzle Game  
* It is simple web-based game in which the image is selected and a grid of tiles according to level is made, each of which shows a separate portion of an image. This grid would automatically resize with the width of the image. One tile from this grid should be missing. Shuffle up the grid of tiles. If a valid tile is clicked, it should move to the empty square. If the tile is invalid nothing would happen.
* In this prject I worked with one other student and we implemented the sliding puzzle game using **HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap and Basic AngularJs**.

### 3. Collab Me  
* Collab Me is a web application that provides information about social media influencers to the brand, and a platform for influencers to provide their service.
* This project was aimed to build a web platform for influencers and brands to grow their business. We implemented this web-application using **HTML, CSS, Bootstap and JavaScript**. In this user can log in as an infuencer or as a Brand and based on user type it provides appropriate functionalities to them. For Brand, it shows the top influenceres on differenct social media platforms whom they can contact, and for influenceres it shows them different Brands available along with their contact details.

### 4. Redefined Chess
* It is a modified chess game. Both the players play at different times with either one’s moves already stored up in the database. This helps in creating a better defense builder or a better attacker, or in other words, a probable clairvoyant.
* The main goal for this project was to develop new version of simple chess game for players who likes to take challenges.  We implemented this chess game using **Python.** It gives player a half played game rather then new game from beginning and player has to come up with strategy to win this game.

### 5. Image Mining

* This project was implemted using **Python**, where the basic model was created and trained which can identify particular searched object in the image and give all the images as a result which contains it.The obejct were limited to Cat, Dog and Person.
