## Bechlor's Projects:
### 1. Assignment Partner 
* It is a web-based application which provides platform to students where they can post their assignment questions which are difficult for them to solve. Other students can see these posted questions and can help each other.
* During my bachlor's this was the first ever project I worked on. In this prject I worked in team of 2 people. We implemented this **rsponsive web-based application** using **HTML and CSS**.

### 2. Sliding Puzzle Game  
* It is simple web-based game in which the image is selected and a grid of tiles according to level is made, each of which shows a separate portion of an image. This grid would automatically resize with the width of the image. One tile from this grid should be missing. Shuffle up the grid of tiles. If a valid tile is clicked, it should move to the empty square. If the tile is invalid nothing would happen.
* In this prject I worked with one other student and we implemented the sliding puzzle game using **HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap and Basic AngularJs**.

### 3. Collab Me
